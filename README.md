# T1Prep: T1 PREProcessing Pipeline (aka PyCAT) 

T1Prep is a pipeline that preprocesses T1-weighted MRI data and supports segmentation and cortical surface reconstruction. It provides a complete set of tools for efficiently processing structural MRI scans.

T1Prep partially integrates [DeepMriPrep](https://github.com/wwu-mmll/deepmriprep), which uses deep learning (DL) techniques to mimic CAT12's functionality for processing structural MRIs. For details, see:
Lukas Fisch et al., "deepmriprep: Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) Preprocessing via Deep Neural Networks," available on arXiv at https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.10656.

An alternative approach uses DeepMriPrep for bias field correction, lesion detection, and also serves as an initial estimate for the subsequent AMAP segmentation from CAT12. 

Cortical surface reconstruction and thickness estimation are performed using [Cortex Analysis Tools for Surface](https://github.com/ChristianGaser/CAT-Surface), a core component of the [CAT12 toolbox](https://github.com/ChristianGaser/cat12).

It is designed for both single-subject and batch processing, with optional parallelization and flexible output naming conventions. The naming patterns are compatible with both 
CAT12 folder structures and the BIDS derivatives standard.

## Requirements
 [Python 3.9-3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required, and all necessary libraries are automatically installed the first time T1Prep is run or is called with the flag "--install".

## Main Differences to CAT12
- Implemented entirely in Python and C, eliminating the need for a Matlab license.
- Newly developed pipeline to estimate cortical surface and thickness.
- Skull-stripping, segmentation and non-linear spatial registration uses DeepMriPrep
- Does not yet support longitudinal pipelines.
- No quality assessment implemented yet.
- Only T1 MRI data supported.

## Output Folder Structure and Naming Conventions

T1Prep automatically determines output locations based on the input data structure:

1. **BIDS datasets**  
   If the input NIfTI is located in an `anat` folder:

`<dataset-root>/derivatives/T1Prep-v<version>/<sub-XXX>/<ses-YYY>/anat/`
   
- Subject (`sub-XXX`) and session (`ses-YYY`) are extracted from the path.
- If `--out-dir <DIR>` is specified, the BIDS substructure will still be created inside `<DIR>`.

2. **Non-BIDS datasets**  
Results are written to **CAT12-style subfolders** (`mri/`, `surf/`, etc.) in:
   
`<input-folder>/<subfolder>/`

or in `<DIR>` if `--out-dir <DIR>` is specified.

3. **Naming Conventions**  
- **Default (CAT12)**: Uses classic names like `mri/brainmask.nii` and `surf/lh.thickness`.
- **With `--bids`**: Uses BIDS derivatives naming, e.g.:
  ```
  sub-01_ses-1_space-T1w_desc-brain_mask.nii.gz
  sub-01_ses-1_hemi-L_thickness.shape.gii
  ```
- All filename mappings for both modes are defined in `Names.tsv` and can be customized.   
   
## Usage
```bash
./scripts/T1Prep [options] file1.nii.[.gz] file2.nii[.gz] ...
```

## Options
Simply call T1Prep to see available options
```bash
./scripts/T1Prep
```

## Output folders strcuture
Output folder structure depends on the input dataset type:
* BIDS datasets (if the upper-level folder of the input files is 'anat'):
    Results are placed in a BIDS-compatible derivatives folder:
    inside &lt;DIR&gt;
    Subject ('sub-XXX') and session ('ses-YYY') are auto-detected.
* Non-BIDS datasets:
    Results are placed in subfolders similar to CAT12 output
    (e.g., 'mri/', 'surf/', 'report/', 'label') inside the specified 
    output directory.

If '--bids' is set, the BIDS derivatives substructure will always be used
inside &lt;DIR&gt;.

## Naming behaviour
* CAT12 style (default): Uses legacy folder and file names
  (e.g., 'mri/mwp1sub-01.nii', 'surf/lh.thickness.sub-01').
* BIDS style: Uses standardized derivatives names, including 
  subject/session identifiers, modality, and processing steps.

The complete mapping between internal outputs and both naming conventions
is stored in 'Names.tsv' and can be customized.

Examples:
Input: /data/study/sub-01/ses-1/anat/sub-01_ses-1_T1w.nii.gz
Default output (no --out-dir):
    /data/study/derivatives/T1Prep-v${version}/sub-01/ses-1/anat/
With --out-dir /results:
    /results/derivatives/T1Prep-v${version}/sub-01/ses-1/anat/

Input: /data/T1_images/subject01.nii.gz
Default output (no --out-dir):
    /data/T1_images/mri/
With --out-dir /results:
    /results/mri/

## Examples
```bash
  ./scripts/T1Prep --out-dir test_folder sTRIO*.nii
```
Process all files matching the pattern 'sTRIO*.nii'. Generate segmentation 
and surface maps, saving the results in the 'test_folder' directory.

```bash
  ./scripts/T1Prep --no-surf sTRIO*.nii
```
Process all files matching the pattern 'sTRIO*.nii', but skip surface 
creation. Only segmentation maps are generated and saved in the same 
directory as the input files.

```bash
  ./scripts/T1Prep --python python3.9 --no-overwrite "surf/lh.thickness." sTRIO*.nii
```
Process all files matching the pattern `'sTRIO*.nii'` and use python3.9. 
Skip processing for files where 'surf/lh.thickness.*' already exists, and 
save new results in the same directory as the input files.

```bash
  ./scripts/T1Prep --lesion --no-sphere sTRIO*.nii
```
Process all files matching the pattern `'sTRIO*.nii'`. Skip processing of 
spherical registration, but additionally save lesion map (named p7sTRIO*.nii) 
in native space.

```bash
  ./scripts/T1Prep --no-amap sTRIO*.nii
```
Process all files matching the pattern `'sTRIO*.nii'` and use DeppMriPrep 
instead of AMAP segmentation.
  
```bash
  ./scripts/T1Prep --multi 8 --p --csf sTRIO*.nii
```
Process all files matching the pattern 'sTRIO*.nii'. Additionally save 
segmentations in native space, including CSF segmentation. The processing 
pipeline involves two stages of parallelization:

1. Segmentation (Python-based): Runs best with about 24GB of memory per 
   process. The number of processes is automatically estimated based on 
   available memory to optimize resource usage.

2. Surface Extraction: This stage does not require significant memory and is
   fully distributed across all available processorsor limited to the 
   defined number of processes using the "--multi" flag.

If "--multi" is set to a specific number (e.g., 8), the system still 
estimates memory-based constraints for segmentation parallelization. However,
the specified number of processes (e.g., 8) will be used for surface 
extraction, ensuring efficient parallelization across the two stages. The 
default setting is -1, which automatically estimates the number of
available processors.
